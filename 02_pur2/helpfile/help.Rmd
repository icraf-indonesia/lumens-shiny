# Overview

Planning unit reconciliation is a process to resolve overlapping permits by referring to function reference maps. Reconciliation is done by analyzing how well the permit data matches the reference data.

# Data and Input Variables

1.  Unresolved Case Map (Shapefile format)

    -   Shapefile of overlayed planning units with some layer that conflict, defined as unresolved case.

2.  Unresolved Case Attribute (Excel format)

    -   Before running PUR Reconcile module, it is necessary to select the reconcile action on drop-down option for every unresolved case in 'PUR_reconciliation_table.xlsx' file generated from PUR Build module. You can use Microsoft Excel or any free spreadsheet software (e.g., Google Sheet) to do it.

# Accessing Outputs

After the analysis completes, you'll find the following output data in your selected output directory:

-   Planning Unit Reconcile (shapefile and raster)

-   Reconciled Class Attribute Result (CSV)

-   **PUR Reconcile Report**: An HTML file providing an overview of the analysis results, including:

    -   Data visualisation on input data
    -   Data visualisation on planning unit reconciliation result
    -   Descriptive statistics resolved case of planning units
