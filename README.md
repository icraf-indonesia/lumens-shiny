# LUMENS (Land Use Planning for Multiple Environmental Services)

## Overview

**LUMENS** is an integrative tool designed to support climate-smart, inclusive, and informed land use planning. This repository hosts the development of LUMENS as an interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) web application, making advanced land use planning tools accessible to practitioners, policymakers, and researchers.

LUMENS has been applied at the district and province (Kabupaten and Provinsi) level in Indonesia and abroad, supporting local planning offices and working groups in developing mitigation action plans. The approach emphasizes:

- **Integrative** : Alignment between conservation, development, and spatial planning.
- **Inclusive**: Early and meaningful stakeholder engagement.
- **Informed**: Transparent, data-driven negotiation support.


Building on experience from previous tools (such as LUWES), LUMENS is adaptable, allowing users to analyze tradeoffs, simulate intervention scenarios, and support negotiation for multifunctional landscapes.

## Features

- **Stakeholder Mapping & Working Groups:** Facilitates inclusive planning through joint outcome mapping and capacity-building workshops.
- **Spatially Explicit Modeling:** Utilizes semi-agent-based models to assess impacts of diverse land use scenarios.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Built with open-source tools (Quantum-GIS, FragStat, R) and designed for future expansion.
- **Minimal Local Data Requirement:** Leverages public remote sensing databases for easy adoption where ground data is limited.
- **Supports Negotiation & Consensus:** Provides a technical backbone for multi-actor negotiation and scenario analysis.
