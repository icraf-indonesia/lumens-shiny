# Overview

Pre-QuES (Preliminary Quantification of Ecosystem Services) is a land use change assessment module that provides key information to identify potential drivers of land use change. This analysis quantifies land cover types and their changes over time, identifies specific land use change trajectories, breaks down changes by administrative or planning units, and visualizes land use dynamics through maps and Sankey-charts.

# Key Concepts:

1. **Land Cover Maps**: Raster files of categorical values representing the spatial distribution of land use/cover types at different time points.

2. **Planning Unit Map**: A raster file delineating administrative or management zones for land use planning.

3. **Land Use/Cover Change**: The transition of land cover types between two time periods.

4. **Change Trajectories**: Specific patterns of land use change, such as deforestation, degradation, or recovery.

# Data Preparation

Before using the Pre-QuES Analysis tool, prepare the following:

1. **Land Cover Maps**: Two raster files (GeoTIFF format) representing land use/cover for two different time points.
2. **Planning Unit Map**: A raster file (GeoTIFF format) or shapefile of administrative or management zones.
3. **Land Use/Cover Lookup Table**: A CSV file describing raster values with their corresponding land cover classes.
4. **Planning Unit Table**: A CSV file describes raster values with their corresponding planning unit classes. This file is required only if the planning unit map is in raster (GeoTIFF) format.
5. **Trajectory Rules**: A CSV file defining rules for classifying land use change trajectories.

## Using the Pre-QuES Analysis Tool

Follow these steps to use the tool:

1. **Land Use/Cover T1**
   - Click "Browse" and select your land cover raster file for the first time point (T1).

2. **T1 Year**
   - Enter the year corresponding to the T1 land cover data.

3. **Land Use/Cover T2**
   - Click "Browse" and select your land cover raster file for the second time point (T2).

4. **T2 Year**
   - Enter the year corresponding to the T2 land cover data.

5. **Land Use/Cover Lookup Table**
   - Click "Browse" and select your prepared CSV file containing the land cover classification scheme.

6. **Planning Units Input Type**
   - Select either "Raster" or "Shapefile" for your planning unit data.

7. **Planning Units**
   - Click "Browse" and select your planning unit raster or shapefile.

8. **Planning Units Lookup**
   - If using a raster, click "Browse" to select a CSV file with planning unit classifications.

9. **Trajectory Rules**
   - Click "Browse" and select your CSV file defining trajectory rules.

10. **Output Directory**
    - Click "Select Output Directory" to choose where results will be saved.

11. **Run Analysis**
    - Click "Run Pre-QuES Analysis" to start the process.

# Accessing Outputs

After the analysis completes, you'll find the following in your selected output directory:

1. **Pre-QuES Land Use Change Transition Table**: A CSV file detailing land cover transitions between T1 and T2.

2. **Change Trajectory Map**: A GeoTIFF file illustrating spatial patterns of land use change trajectories.

3. **Forest Change Trajectory Map**: A GeoTIFF file showing forest-specific change patterns (e.g., deforestation, degradation).

4. **Pre-QuES Report**: An HTML file providing a comprehensive overview of the analysis results, including:
   - Land cover composition tables and graphs
   - Sankey diagrams of land use dynamics
   - Top land use changes at landscape and planning unit levels
   - Trajectory analysis results and visualizations

These outputs will help you understand land use change patterns, identify potential drivers of change, and inform land use planning and management decisions.
