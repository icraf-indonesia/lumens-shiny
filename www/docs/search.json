    "text": "In the face of escalating climate change, biodiversity loss, and food insecurity, the need for sustainable land-use planning has never been more critical. The Land Use Planning for Multiple Environmental Services (LUMENS) tool, developed by the CIFOR-ICRAF, offers a powerful solution to navigate the complexities of landscape management. LUMENS empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions that balance economic development with environmental conservation.\nLUMENS is specifically designed to support multi-stakeholder negotiations in planning landscapes that can balance development needs with environmental conservation, particularly in tropical regions. It is based on user-friendly, publicly available software and promotes inclusive, integrated, and informed land-use negotiations.\nThe tool incorporates a spatially-explicit, semi-agent-based model capable of handling a wide array of scenarios, requiring minimal input data, making it suitable for regions with limited data availability.\n\nKey Features and Benefits\n\nInclusive and Participatory: LUMENS fosters collaboration among diverse stakeholders, including government agencies, local communities, indigenous groups, and the private sector. It ensures that all voices are heard and considered in the planning process.\nIntegrated Approach: LUMENS breaks down silos by integrating various environmental services, such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and water resource management, into a unified planning framework.\nInformed Decision-Making: LUMENS utilizes a spatially explicit, semi-agent-based model to simulate the impacts of different land-use scenarios. This allows stakeholders to explore trade-offs and identify sustainable pathways. User-Friendly and Accessible: LUMENS is built on publicly available software and requires minimal input data, making it suitable for regions with limited resources.\nAdaptable and Scalable: LUMENS can be tailored to specific contexts and applied at various scales, from local communities to national jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nApplications and Impact\nLUMENS has been successfully applied in various landscapes across the globe, including Indonesia and Vietnam. It has facilitated the development of Green Growth Action Plans that promote sustainable economic development while safeguarding critical environmental services. LUMENS has also been instrumental in resolving land-use conflicts, enhancing community participation, and informing policy decisions.\n\n\nThe Core Principles\nLUMENS is built on three core principles that guide its approach to sustainable landscape management:\n\nInclusive: LUMENS recognizes that effective land-use planning requires the active participation of all stakeholders. It fosters collaboration and ensures that diverse perspectives, including those of local communities, indigenous groups, and marginalized populations, are considered in decision-making. This inclusive approach helps build consensus and promotes equitable outcomes.\nInformed: LUMENS emphasizes the importance of evidence-based decision-making. It utilizes scientific data, local knowledge, and scenario modeling to inform stakeholders about the potential impacts of different land-use options. This informed approach helps to minimize risks and maximize benefits for both people and the environment.\nIntegrative: LUMENS breaks down silos by integrating various environmental services, such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and water resource management, into a unified planning framework. It also connects land-use planning with broader development goals, ensuring that decisions are aligned with sustainable development objectives. This integrative approach promotes holistic and synergistic solutions that address the complex challenges of landscape management.\n\nThese three principles work together to empower stakeholders to make informed and inclusive decisions that balance economic development with environmental conservation. By fostering collaboration, utilizing scientific evidence, and integrating diverse perspectives, LUMENS paves the way for a more sustainable and equitable future for our landscapes.\n\n\nThe LUMENS Process\nLUMENS guides stakeholders through a seven-stage co-production process:\n\nScoping and Stakeholder Mapping: Identifying key stakeholders and their interests.\nData Collection and Analysis: Gathering and analyzing spatial and socio-economic data.\nPlanning Unit Reconciliation: Reconciling different perspectives on land use and zoning.\nScenario Development: Developing and simulating alternative land-use scenarios.\nImpact Assessment: Evaluating the environmental, social, and economic impacts of each scenario.\nNegotiation and Selection: Facilitating stakeholder negotiations to select the most sustainable scenario.\nAction Planning and Implementation: Developing and implementing action plans to achieve the desired outcomes.\n\n\n\nComponents of LUMENS\nLUMENS operates as both a process and a tool, facilitating the integration of diverse stakeholder perspectives and scientific data into land-use planning decisions. The primary components include:\n\nPlanning Unit Reconciliation (PUR): This module helps identify and resolve conflicts and inconsistencies in land use, tenure, and stakeholder perspectives. It enables the creation of reconciled planning units that serve as the foundation for subsequent analysis and negotiation.\n\nPurpose: The PUR module facilitates the identification and resolution of conflicts and inconsistencies in land use, tenure, and stakeholder perspectives. It helps create a shared understanding of the landscape and its challenges.\nProcess: The module combines multiple layers of spatial and socio-economic data, including land allocations, permits, land suitability, and stakeholder perspectives. It then identifies areas of conflict or overlap and provides a platform for stakeholders to negotiate and reconcile these differences.\nOutcome: The reconciled planning units serve as the foundation for subsequent analysis and negotiation, ensuring that land-use decisions are based on a shared understanding of the landscape and its complexities.\n\nQuantification of Environmental Services: LUMENS assesses the impact of land-use change on various environmental services, such as carbon storage, biodiversity, and water resources. It utilizes established models like ABACUS, SWAT, and GenRiver to quantify these impacts.\n\nPurpose: This component assesses the impact of land-use change on various environmental services, providing critical information for decision-making.\nProcess: LUMENS utilizes established models like ABACUS (for carbon storage), SWAT and GenRiver (for water resources), and DIFA (for biodiversity) to quantify the impacts of land-use change on these services.\nOutcome: The quantification of environmental services enables stakeholders to understand the potential consequences of different land-use decisions and identify scenarios that minimize negative impacts and maximize benefits.\n\nTrade-off Analysis: The tool enables the evaluation of trade-offs between different land-use scenarios, considering economic benefits, environmental impacts, and social implications. This helps stakeholders make informed decisions that balance competing objectives.\n\nPurpose: This component helps stakeholders evaluate the trade-offs between different land-use scenarios, considering economic, environmental, and social factors.\nProcess: LUMENS compares the outcomes of different scenarios in terms of economic benefits (e.g., land-use profitability), environmental impacts (e.g., carbon emissions, biodiversity loss), and social implications (e.g., employment, food security).\nOutcome: The trade-off analysis provides stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences of different decisions, enabling them to identify solutions that balance competing objectives.\n\nSimulation and Scenario Development: LUMENS allows for the development and simulation of various land-use scenarios, including ‘business-as-usual’ and alternative ‘green’ development pathways. This enables stakeholders to explore the potential consequences of different decisions and identify sustainable solutions.\n\nPurpose: This component allows stakeholders to explore the potential consequences of different land-use decisions and identify sustainable solutions.\nProcess: LUMENS enables the development and simulation of various land-use scenarios, including ‘business-as-usual’ and alternative ‘green’ development pathways. The model incorporates spatial and temporal dynamics, as well as stakeholder inputs and preferences.\nOutcome: The simulation and scenario development process provides stakeholders with a powerful tool for exploring the future of their landscape and identifying pathways that promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.\n\n\nIn essence, LUMENS acts as a bridge between science and society, facilitating informed and inclusive decision-making for sustainable landscape management.

    "text": "5.2 Usage\n\n5.2.1 Workflow\nThe workflow for this module can be divided into four key steps.\n\nData preparation. In this step, users prepare the necessary data, noting the correct input specifications.\nUpload data. Once all the data has been prepared, users input the data by clicking Browse or manually dragging the input data to the correct attribute.\nSet parameters. The user sets the parameters of the multiple time series analysis they wish to conduct, which includes sampling points, window size and shape, and a fragstats configuration (optional).\nAnalyze results. Upon completion, the user will find the analysis results in the module or directly in the output folder. The module generates a webpage report containing a brief description of the module, summary of input data, and results containing visualizations of focal area map, TECI map, sampling grid, and DIFA plot.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Step-by-step instructions\nStep 1: Data Preparation\nBefore using the QuES-B Analysis tool, prepare the following:\n\nLand Cover Map: A raster file of current land use/land cover (LULC) in GeoTIFF format.\nLand Use/Cover & Focal Area Lookup Table: A CSV file describing raster values with their corresponding land cover classes. Users define focal areas by selecting specific land cover classes.\nEdge Contrast Table: An FSQ file defining edge contrast between land cover types.\n(Optional) FRAGSTATS Configuration file.\n\nStep 2: Uploading Data\nInput your data into the left-hand side of the module by selecting the ‘Browse’ button for each data or drag your file from your computer into the data input box. Ensure that you upload the correct data input for each parameter. A blue bar with ‘Upload complete’ will appear once you have successfully input your data for each parameter.\n\nLand cover: Click “Browse” and select your prepared land cover raster file. Ensure that the data is in GeoTIFF format with the relevant UTM projection system.\nYear: Enter the year of your land cover data (e.g., 2010). This must be numeric.\nNo Data Class: Enter the value representing missing land cover data in your raster, e.g., cloud or shadow (default is 0).\nLand Use/Cover & Focal Area Lookup Table: Click “Browse” and select your prepared CSV file.\nEdge Contrast Table: Click “Browse” and select your prepared FSQ file.\n\n\nStep 3: Setting Analysis Parameters\n\nSet your desired sampling points. Data sampling is used to determine the exact landform for an area so that when illustrated on a map it will define the landform at its true scale. While default sampling point is 1000, meaning there will be 1000 points in the data that will be used for further processing, note users can input higher or lower values. The more sampling points correlates with a more sampling grids for calculating DIFA and more accurate analysis but will require longer processing time.\n\nSet your desired window size and shape. A window size represents the dispersal radius, a threshold for ecological connectivity, if taxa associated with the focal area can typically move or disperse up to this distance. Window shape determines the dispersal form for each sampling size. Users can choose between square or circle form in the drop-down menu. Circle shape is more realistic but requires more computing resources and time.\n\nOptionally, you may input a fragstats configuration and the directory it is derived from. The default path will be used if not specified, assuming the default Fragstats installation directory.\n\nSelect your output directory where you wish to save your report. Finish by clicking ‘Select’.\n\n\nStep 4: Running the Analysis\nClick on ‘Run QuES-B Analysis’ to initiate the analysis. A progress bar will appear on the bottom right corner, indicating the analysis status. Once completed, you may access your results by clicking ‘Open Report’ or ‘Open Output Folder’.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Tips\n\nLarge sampling points and window size result in a higher accuracy for calculating the focal area habitat distribution, contrast, and integration but require longer processing time and resources.\nMovement of wildlife and seeds move naturally within a particular habitat. While opting for circular window shape may more realistically accommodate biodiversity movements, square window shapes allow for faster computing of TECI across the study area.",

    "text": "5.5 Theoretical Background\n\n5.5.1 Model Description\nQuES-B quantifies the composition and configuration of habitats as an approach to describing biodiversity conditions at the landscape scale. This analysis is performed by calculating the Degree of Integration of Focal Area (DIFA) index, focusing on the composition and configuration of focal areas.\n\n\n5.5.2 Key Concepts:\nFocal Area:\n\nA focal area is defined as the taxa of interest or areas with high biodiversity. Users define these by selecting specific land cover classes.\nThe module will generate a Total Edge Contrast Index (TECI) map, illustrating the spatial distribution of focal area fragmentation and integration across the landscape by measuring contrast between adjacent land cover types, and Degree of Integration of Focal Area (DIFA) index, which quantifies how well integrated a focal area is within a landscape, indicating its capacity to conserve biodiversity.\nQUES-B enables the comparison of the integration of focal areas across various zones or landscapes, assessment of temporal changes in habitat integration, and identification of vulnerable areas for conservation prioritization. In analyzing the dynamics of the focal area, the QUES-B module considers not only its area but also its spatial configuration. In other words, connectivity and dysconnectivity between focal area patches affect the output of the analysis.\n\nTECI Map:\n\nThe habitat approach hypothesizes that biodiversity within a particular habitat is more vulnerable when focal areas edges are directly adjacent to land cover classes with a high degree of difference compared to classes with a low degree of difference.\nIn understanding TECI results, a value that approaches zero suggests a lower contrast between a focal area cell and the surrounding patches, indicating strong permeability for wildlife and higher chance for the habitat to sustain species biodiversity.\nOn the other hand, a maximum value of one hundred is associated with conditions where the focal area is very different from the pixels surrounding it (example: the focal area is a primary forest cover class that is ‘surrounded’ by built up area) hence lower permeability leading to lower habitat biodiversity.\n\nDegree of Integration of Focal Area (DIFA) Index:\n\nThe magnitude of the DIFA value is influenced by several factors such as: total area, configuration and spatial distribution of the focal area at a certain point in time as well as the contrast of the focal area with the surrounding area. For instance, the need to clear forest areas for agriculture not only changes the surrounding land use into non-forest, but also leads to loss of forest area and decreases forest intactness.\nUnderstanding these dynamics, an increase in DIFA indicates increasingly ideal conditions in the focal area which means the habitat is more intact and likely to support the local biodiversity.\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Key Assumptions\n\n\n5.5.4 Limitations\n\nAccuracy is limited by the quality and resolution of the input maps.",

For policymakers, the summary highlights a general understanding of soil erosion dynamics, which may be used as initial context for strategic planning on soil conservation efforts.  \nSection 2: Module Description\nThis section states the focus of the module, namely on soil erosion risk assessment using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and mentions plans for future hydrological analysis features.\nSection 3: Input Data\nThis section will present all input data to users in map format.\n\nTotal annual precipitation map displays the distribution of rainfall across the region over the span of one year. Each pixel in the map represents the total rainfall in millimeters (mm) per year. Areas with the highest total annual precipitation are displayed in yellow-green shades, while blue-purple shades indicate regions with lower annual precipitation. Identifying areas with higher or lower levels of precipitation allows users to understand conditions of water availability, agricultural potential and flood risks.\n\nThe Digital Elevation Model (DEM) map illustrates the terrain elevation meters above sea level. Areas with higher elevations are displayed in yellow-green, while areas with lower elevations are displayed in blue-purple. This map is helpful for understanding the topography of the area, providing insight towards drainage patterns and erosion potential.\n\nSoil properties maps showcase soil characteristics, defined by clay, silt, sand, and organic soil content, at a depth of 0 to 5cm in the study area. Each map has a color scale bar indicating the range of values, with the highest values in the yellow-green spectrum and the lowest in the blue-purple spectrum. Use this to identify variations across the region. By analyzing all four maps together, you can better understand the relationships between soil components (e.g., areas with high clay content may have different organic carbon levels compared to sandy regions).\n\n\nSand content map shows the content of sand in soil at a depth of 0 to 5cm. Areas with high sand content tend to have more porous soils with better drainage but lower nutrient retention, while areas with lower sand content may have more compact soils.\nSilt content map shows the content of silt in soil at the same depth. Areas with higher silt content are likely to retain moisture better than those with less silt, influencing water retention capacity and soil fertility. However, the same areas may also be prone to erosion.\nClay content map illustrates the percentage of clay in soil. Areas with rich clay content may hold more water and nutrients than areas with less clay but may have poor drainage potentially leading to waterlogging in certain areas.\nSoil organic carbon (SOC) content map illustrates soil organic carbon in grams per kilogram. High SOC areas are generally more fertile and better for plant growth, while lower SOC regions might indicate depleted or less fertile soils.\n\nLand cover map displays spatial information on land cover classes of the study area within the set time frame. Using a categorical raster format, each pixel displays different land cover classes. The map is aided with a legend on the right-hand side that lists the land cover classes and their corresponding colours.\n\n\n\nIdentify the dominant land cover classes and their spatial distribution. The dominant color on the map shows the dominant land cover classes in the study area. In the picture above, for instance, dark blue areas are found in the bottom left-hand corner of the map while blue-green areas are found in most of the study area. This may indicate that forest areas, shown in dark blue, are found in concentration, while the majority of the study area shown in blue-green are of agriculture-based land uses, such as rubber, oil palm, and agroforestry.\nCompare changes in land use over time. You may identify shifts in the spatial distribution of land use classes over T1 dan T2. For example, the increase of green pixels in 2010 from previously dark blue pixels in 2005 may indicate agricultural expansion on once forest-based land uses.\n\nPlanning unit map displays the management zones of the study area. The map shown corresponds to the legend on the right-hand side of the map, indicating the color of each zone.\n\nSection 4: Results\nThe report presents two analysis results, namely RUSLE factor maps and estimated soil erosion.\nRUSLE Factor Maps\nThis section visualizes each RUSLE factor through a spatial distribution map. Users will find distribution maps for R factor (rainfall erosivity), K factor (soil erodibility), LS factor (length and steepness), C factor (cover management), and P factor (practice management). For all maps, areas with higher factor values displayed to towards the shade of yellow, while areas with lower factor values are displayed to towards the shade of dark blue.\n\nR factor map shows the spatial distribution of the effect of rainfall on soil erosion. The erosivity of rainfall is interpreted as the average amount of rainfall erosivity energy per area, calculated based on hourly rainfall intensities and averaged over a year. Rainfall erosivity is mostly affected by short-term, high-intensity precipitation events. This factor was generated using the method of Moore (1979). Higher R factor areas suggest more intense rainfall events that are more likely to cause erosion. Lower R factor areas have less erosive rainfall.\n\nK factor map illustrates the spatial distribution of soil erodibility based on its soil properties measured in tons of soil loss per hectare per unit of rainfall erosivity. This factor was generated using the method of Williams (1995) by combining physical soil parameters such as sand, silt, and clay fractions, along with the organic carbon (or organic matter) fraction in the topsoil layer. Areas with higher K factor values are more prone to erosion than areas with lower K factor values.\n\nLS factor map (unitless) displays the combined effects of length and slope on erosion potential. This factor was generated from digital elevation model data using the method of Moore & Burch (1986). Areas with higher LS factor values suggest steeper or longer slopes, contributing to higher potential of soil erosion.\n\nC factor maps (unitless) illustrate the effects of vegetation cover on the overall impact of soil erosion. This factor was generated using land use classifications from land cover products and agronomic statistics, with C factor values are either available from government data, global data products, or derived from research references. The C factor relates the soil loss from land with specific vegetation cover to the soil loss that would occur from clean-tilled, continuously fallow land. Areas with more vegetation are more protected from higher impacts of raindrop on the soil.\nIn two step time series analysis, the module will generate the C factor map for T1 dan T2.\n\nP factor map (unitless) illustrates the spatial distribution of support practice impact on soil erosion. The control practices can reduce the potential of erosion by reducing the amount and velocity of run-off, modifying the flow pattern and direction of surface run-off. The value ranges of P factor are between 0 and 1. In this model, as the P factor is assumed to be equal to 1, the module generates a single-color map.\n\n\nEstimation of Soil Erosion\nUsers will find estimation of soil erosion at landscape level and at the planning unit level.\n\nSoil Erosion at Landscape Level\nSoil erosion results are categorized into six categories, namely Slight erosion (&lt;5 ton/ha/year), Mild (5-25 ton/ha/year), Moderate (25-50 ton/ha/year), Strong (50-80 ton/ha/year), Very Strong (80-150 ton/ha/year) and Severe (&gt;150 ton/ha/year). The darker the color on the map indicates a lighter estimation of soil erosion. Conversely, a lighter color suggests stronger soil erosion. For two step analysis, the module will generate maps for T1 and T2.\n\nFor a more detailed account of soil erosion per category, the soil erosion map distribution correlates with the subsequent table. Users will find and be able sort soil erosion rates by area and percentage.\nAs policymakers, the information on soil erosion at the landscape level suggests important insights on the severity of soil erosion, where it occurs, and trend. In particular, the information may be useful in identifying high risk areas, understand landscape variability, assert baseline data and foster collaboration in implementing soil conservation strategies.\n\nSoil Erosion at Planning Unit Level\nThe following three tables present the crosstabulation of soil erosion categories for each planning unit in the study year(s). For instance, users will be able to identify and compare the total area of all soil erosion categories planning unit Hutan Lindung (ha), noting that planning unit Perkebunan and Pertanian Lahan Basah has a larger area with severe soil erosion risk, at 1.442 and 1.522 ha respectively in 2010. For two step analysis, users are supplemented with a trajectory table of soil erosion changes from T1 to T2.\n\nInsights from these tables could provide valuable information for policymakers, for instance:\n\nIdentify priority areas for intervention. With spatially explicit insights, policymakers will be able to identify high-risk areas for soil erosion mitigation and landscape restoration. Using the planning unit, land management policies may be able to focus on land uses that are more vulnerable to soil erosion.\nIdentify spatial distribution of soil erosion risk factors. The module generates maps for each RUSLE factor, suggesting spatially explicit information on areas with lower or higher risk. This allows for more specific strategies on increasing soil erosion resiliency.\nIdentify trends over multiple periods of time. Trajectory of soil erosion between T1 and T2 provides insight into the areas with no changes, decreasing and increasing risk of soil erosion.",

The results highlight land-use efficiency, economic returns, and trade-offs, providing a foundation for policy formulation and land management strategies.\n\nOpportunity Cost Table\n\n\nThe opportunity cost table illustrates the economic trade-offs associated with different land-use decisions by comparing the potential income from alternative uses of land. The table shows that:\n\nForestry and agroforestry systems have relatively lower opportunity costs due to their carbon sequestration potential, making them attractive under carbon payment schemes.\nMonoculture expansion incurs higher opportunity costs, particularly in high-biodiversity or high-carbon storage areas. This suggests that converting these areas into monoculture agricultural land might lead to significant losses in ecosystem services, such as carbon storage, which could otherwise be monetized through carbon credits.\n\nFrom the table, it’s evident that policymakers should prioritize land uses that balance economic returns with environmental sustainability. For example, lands with high opportunity costs should be earmarked for conservation or low-impact uses, rather than agriculture or urban expansion.\n\nOpportunity Cost Curve\n\n\nThe opportunity cost curve can provide insights into the financial performance of a land-use type over a set time horizon.\nUnderstanding axis\n\nX-Axis (Horizontal Axis):\nTypically represents time (years) or a varying parameter, such as the discount rate, cost factors, or revenues. If the X-axis shows time, the curve will reflect how the opportunity cost evolves throughout the time period.\nY-Axis (Vertical Axis):\nRepresents the opportunity cost value, in this case is monetary per carbon (i.e., USD/ton CO2-eq). It indicates the cumulative value discounted to present terms at each point on the curve.\n\nKey points of the curve\n\nInitial Opportunity Cost (Year 0):\nThe curve typically starts at an initial at Year 0, which is often negative if the project requires an upfront investment (e.g., land acquisition, infrastructure setup). A negative result at this point indicates the project hasn’t generated enough returns yet to cover the initial costs.\nBreak even Point (OpCost = 0):\nThe point where the NPV curve crosses the horizontal axis (OpCost = 0) is the break even point. This is the year when the project begins to generate enough returns to cover all costs, including the discount factor.\nPositive Zone:\nThe area where the curve rises above the horizontal axis indicates periods where the project is generating a positive return. The height of the curve in this zone indicates the magnitude of the profitability—higher OpCost values mean greater financial returns relative to the initial investment.\nSlope of the Curve:\nThe slope of the OpCost curve indicates how fast it is accumulating value. A steep positive slope suggests high returns over time, whereas a flat or gently sloping curve indicates slow growth. A negative slope could indicate declining revenues or increased costs in later years.\nLong-Term Value:\nAt the end of the time horizon, the value shows the total profitability of the project. If the Opportunity Cost remains positive, the project is expected to be profitable by the end of the time period. If the curve dips back into negative territory, it could signal declining profitability or unsustainable project dynamics over the long term.",

Understanding these results can aid in policy and decision making.\n\n1. Analysis of Sectoral Linkages\nSectoral linkage consists of Direct Backward Linkage (DBL) and Direct Forward Linkage (DFL) represents connection between sector in a regional economy.\n\n\nDirect Backward Linkage (DBL): This indicates how much demand a sector creates for inputs from other sectors. If a sector shows a strong backward linkage, it suggests that it relies heavily on other industries for resources and services.\n\n\nA high backward linkage in fisheries (perikanan) means that expanding this sector will boost demand for inputs from upstream industries, such as raw materials and intermediate goods. Policymakers might focus on strengthening supply chains for these industries to support the growth.\nIf agriculture (pertanian) shows weak backward linkages, interventions could aim to improve integration with suppliers (e.g., fertilizers, machinery) to enhance sectoral efficiency.\n\nDirect Forward Linkage (DFL): This measures how much output from a sector is used as an input by other sectors. A high forward linkage implies that many industries depend on this sector’s output.\n\n\nIf the service (jasa/lain-lain) sector exhibits strong forward linkages, improvements in energy production can positively impact other industries like manufacturing, transport, and services.\nPolicymakers could prioritize investments in communication (komunikasi) infrastructure to reduce costs and stimulate industrial productivity, based on strong forward linkage results.\n\nSectoral Typology: This categorizes sectors based on their linkages and growth potential. Sectors can be classified as key sectors, dependent sectors, or independent sectors.\n\nKey sectors exhibit both strong forward and backward linkages, meaning they play a crucial role in the region’s economy, in this graph is livestock (peternakan). Development efforts could prioritize these sectors to maximize overall economic impact, it would be a priority for both investment and policy support because of its ripple effects across multiple industries.\n\nGraph Interpretation: The forward and backward linkage graph helps visualize these relationships, highlighting which sectors drive demand for inputs and supply outputs critical for the economy.\n\n\n2. Analysis of GDP\nThe GDP table presents data for each sector’s contribution to the region’s GDP, showing trends over time. This can reveal whether certain sectors are growing or shrinking in economic significance.\n\nThe accompanying graph visually represents GDP growth by sector, making it easier to spot trends such as emerging industries or declining traditional sectors. In this graph, electricity and water (listrik dan air) is the leading GDP sector, followed by trade (perdagangan). This graphs showed that Bungo’s economic dominated by service or secondary industry.\n\n\n\n3. Analysis of Multiplier\n\nOutput Multiplier: This shows how much additional output is generated for each unit of output in a sector. A high output multiplier indicates that a sector has strong spillover effects on the wider economy.\n\n\nIf the fisheries (perikanan) sector has a high output multiplier, it means that expanding construction activities will drive significant additional production in related sectors like fish feed (pakan) and transportation.\nPolicymakers might focus on promoting fisheries projects as part of a stimulus strategy, leveraging its strong multiplier effect to boost overall economic growth.\n\nInput Multiplier: This reflects how much additional input a sector demands from others. Sectors with high input multipliers create substantial demand for upstream products.\n\n\nIf the electricity and water (listrik dan air minum) sector has a high input multiplier, enhancing its productivity can stimulate demand in raw materials and intermediate goods sectors.\nPromoting domestic supply chains for rice (padi) can reduce dependency on imports, strengthen local industries, and generate employment.\n\nLabour Multiplier: This represents the number of jobs generated for each unit of output in a sector. A high labor multiplier indicates that the sector is labor-intensive and can create employment opportunities.\n\n\nIf restaurant and hotels exhibits a high labor multiplier, supporting this sector can lead to significant job creation, especially in tourism areas.\nPolicymakers might design tourism development programs focused on ecotourism to balance between economic and environmental health.\n\n\n\n\n4. Land Requirement Table and Coefficient\n\nLand Requirement: This table outlines the amount of land required by each sector based on production levels and sectoral needs. It quantifies how much land is used or will be needed to sustain economic activities.\n\n\nA high land requirement for agriculture (pertanian) might indicate that increased agricultural output is land-intensive, potentially leading to land scarcity or environmental degradation. Sustainable land use practices should be considered in such cases.\nIf service sectors show lower land requirements but high output, this could suggest that economic development could be shifted towards more land-efficient service to preserve natural resources.\n\nLand Use Coefficient: This coefficient represents the efficiency of land use by each sector. A higher coefficient means that a sector uses land more efficiently relative to its output.\n\n\nSectors with low land use coefficients (e.g., agriculture) may require modernization or shifts to more efficient practices to increase productivity while minimizing land consumption.\nIf forestry shows a high land requirement coefficient, policies might focus on reforestation or sustainable forestry management to enhance land use efficiency while supporting environmental goals.",

GDP Table per Sector\n\nThis table provides a sector-by-sector breakdown of the GDP under both the BAU and alternative scenario. The key points of interpretation include:\n\nSectoral Contributions: Identify which sectors contribute the most to GDP in each scenario. For instance, agriculture, manufacturing, or services might dominate in different scenarios.\nScenario Comparison: Compare the GDP contribution of each sector between BAU and the alternative scenario to determine how the alternative policy interventions affect the economic structure.\nGrowth Trends: Highlight which sectors are expected to grow or decline under each scenario. If certain sectors, like green industries, show significant growth in the alternative scenario, it reflects a shift towards sustainable economic activities.\n\nIn the alternative scenario, we observe a XXX increase in the GDP contribution from agriculture, while the BAU scenario continues to rely on mining sector, indicating the potential for a more sustainable economic pathway.\n\n\n2. GDP Comparison Graph\n\nThis graph compares overall GDP growth between the BAU and alternative scenarios over the analysis period. Key aspects to interpret include:\n\nEconomic Growth: Look at the rate of GDP growth in both scenarios. The alternative scenario may show slower growth initially but could exhibit more stability in the long term if it is aligned with sustainable development goals.\nSustainability Trade-offs: Compare whether the alternative scenario sacrifices short-term GDP growth for long-term sustainability. If BAU shows higher immediate growth, this could come at the expense of environmental degradation or social inequalities.\nKey Inflections: Identify points where the alternative scenario may outperform BAU, suggesting a shift in economic trajectory due to sustainable policies.\n\nThe GDP growth under the BAU scenario is higher in the first five years, but the alternative scenario overtakes it by the third period, indicating that sustainable practices lead to more resilient, long-term growth.\n\n\n3. Output Comparison Graph\n\nThe output comparison graph shows the total economic output generated by different sectors in both scenarios. Key interpretations include:\n\nSectoral Output Changes: Analyze which sectors experience significant output shifts between the scenarios. For example, in the alternative scenario, you might see increased output from eco-friendly industries, renewable energy, or sustainable agriculture.\nDiversification of Output: The alternative scenario may lead to a more diversified economy if policies promote new sectors, reducing reliance on a few dominant industries.\nEconomic Efficiency: If the alternative scenario achieves higher output with less resource consumption (e.g., land, water), it may indicate improved economic efficiency.\n\nThe alternative scenario results in a 25% increase in output from the sustainable agriculture sector, while the BAU scenario remains dependent on extractive industries, reflecting a more diverse and resilient economic base in the alternative pathway.\n\n\n4. Income Comparison Graph\n\nThis graph reflects the distribution of income across sectors and scenarios, highlighting impacts on livelihoods and equity. Interpretations include:\n\nIncome Growth by Sector: Analyze how incomes change in both scenarios, especially for sectors with a large labor force like agriculture or manufacturing.\nEquitable Income Distribution: The alternative scenario may lead to more equitable income distribution if policies are geared toward inclusive economic growth (e.g., through job creation in sustainable industries).\nSectoral Shifts: A shift in income towards green sectors in the alternative scenario could indicate that sustainable economic policies are creating new, higher-paying jobs in emerging sectors.\n\nIncomes in the alternative scenario show a 20% rise in the agricultural sector, while the BAU scenario continues to see income concentration in extractive industries, indicating a fairer distribution of wealth and better livelihood opportunities in the alternative scenario.\n\n\n5. Labour Comparison Graph\n\nThis graph provides insight into employment trends in both scenarios. Key interpretations include:\n\nEmployment Growth: Compare overall employment growth between the scenarios. The alternative scenario may promote job creation in emerging sectors like sustainable agriculture.\nSectoral Employment Shifts: Identify which sectors gain or lose jobs in each scenario. The alternative scenario may show a shift away from resource-intensive sectors towards green sectors.\nLabor Productivity: A scenario where labor demand decreases but output increases may indicate higher productivity, which could signal more efficient land and resource use.\n\nInterpretation Example: The alternative scenario shows a 10% increase in labor demand in the agricultural sector compared to BAU, suggesting that the shift towards sustainable development is also creating new employment opportunities.",

    "text": "5. Theoretical Background\n\n5.1 Model Description\nThe Regional Economic Projection module compares the economic outcomes between the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario and an alternative (ALT) scenario, typically aimed at promoting sustainable land use and green economy initiatives. The module utilizes projection algorithms that estimate future economic indicators such as GDP, output, income, and labor, based on land use dynamics and sectoral activity. The model integrates both economic and environmental data to project the effects of land-use decisions and policy interventions.\n\nScenario Inputs: Each scenario (BAU vs. ALT) is defined by different assumptions regarding land use, resource management, and policy measures. These inputs are processed to forecast economic outcomes over a specific time horizon.\nEconomic Projections: The module assesses sectoral performance by estimating indicators such as GDP, output, income, and labor for each sector. A comparative analysis highlights the impact of sustainable policies versus a continuation of current practices (BAU).\n\n\n\n5.2 Key Assumptions\nKey assumptions in the model are as follows:\n\nThe model assumes that the land-use and economic sector data (such as current land cover, resource availability, and sector productivity) accurately represent real-world conditions.\nThe model assumes that land-use changes occur in a relatively linear fashion across the analysis period. Major shocks or nonlinear shifts in land use, such as natural disasters or rapid technological advancements, may not be captured fully.\n\n\n\n5.3 Limitations\nThe module limitations and potential sources of error/uncertainty are as follows:\n\nThe accuracy of projections is highly dependent on the quality of input data, particularly land-use maps and sectoral economic data. Inconsistent or outdated data could result in unreliable or skewed outcomes. High-resolution and up-to-date land-use maps are critical for precise scenario analysis.\nThe model simplifies land-use dynamics and may not account for gradual or complex changes within land-use categories.",

    "text": "2. Usage\n\n2.1 Workflow\n[Users start by uploading the QUES-C database, which includes essential data such as planning units, the corresponding year, area (in hectares), and the matrix of land use change. Then, select or define various scenarios based on development policy, conservation efforts, economic development strategies, or plans. The module processes the input data and selected parameters to simulate land use and cover changes over time. It generates comprehensive maps and statistics that detail land use changes across different planning units, along with net emission offsets (CO2eq) under different scenarios.]\n\n\n\n2.2 Step-by-step instructions Step 1: Uploading QUES-C Database\n\n\nLoad QUES-C Database\n\nNavigate to the “Data” tab in the main interface of the Scenario Builder module.\n\nClick the “Browse” Button:\n\nSelect the “Browse” button to begin importing your QUES-C database. The file should be in CSV format.\nAfter selecting your file, click “OK” to upload the data. The system will notify you once the upload is successful.\n\n\n\n\nSelect output directory where results will be saved, Click ‘+’ to save and Select.\n\nClick “Run” Button.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Select and Define Scenario\n\nNavigate to the “Scenario” Tab:\n\nAfter running the analysis, the “Scenario” tab will be open. Users cam begin defining the specific land use change scenarios for analysis. Select the period by clicking the horizontal year axis on the area chart. In this exercise, we will use 2010-2015.\n\n\nBaseline Scenario:\n\nBaseline scenario represents the current land use conditions and will be used as the reference for comparing future changes. Users can select scenario. For instance Scenario 1 and change it to Baseline Scenario as reference. We can see that under baseline scenario, some areas in primary forest (hutan primer) converted to other land uses, including rubber and oil palm.\n\n\nUnder the baseline scenario, the largest projected areas are oil palm, followed by monoculture rubber. This will contribute to an increase of net emission which is about 70 million tCO2-eq.\n\nDefine Alternative Scenarios:\n\nAdd and describe the different land use change scenarios based on alternative policy interventions or development trajectories. Each scenario should outline changes in land use such as deforestation, agricultural expansion, or conservation efforts. Example of set scenarios ar as follows:\na. ambitious scenario\nThis scenario aims to reduce deforestation. It simulates a series of land use changes designed to enhance sustainability. Specifically, all conversions from natural forest to non-natural forest are entirely prevented, and no primary forest areas are allowed to be converted to other land uses.\n\nb. moderate scenario\nThis scenario focuses on any changes from primary forest to other land covers are halted, while forest covers are actively expanded through planting efforts. Monoculture plantations, such as rubber and oil palm, are transitioned into agroforestry systems, and some areas of open land are also converted to agroforestry, supporting biodiversity and sustainable land management.\n\n\nModify the projection areas based on defined scenario\nFor instance, in ambitious scenario, all conversions from natural forest to non-natural forest are entirely prevented.\nSelect “zone”, here users will find the planning units.\n\nClick the converted land cover graph to see the baseline result as follows.\n\nChange the all modified conversion into “0” which means there will remain primary forest.\nThe result should look like this and click “Update”.\n\nDo the projection changes to other zones that have “hutan primer” (primary forest)\n\nOn the bottom right of the page, users will see the scenario details as follow.\n\n\nMonitor Emission Changes:\n\n\nAs you define each scenario, you can observe gradual changes in net emissions (CO2eq) in the summary provided at the bottom right of the page. This helps in understanding the long-term impact of land use decisions on emissions. For example from the ambitious scenario below.\n\nIt means that in between 2010-2015, changes of projected area has contributed to the net emission offset for about -36.8 per cent. The resume box shows below that it reduce almost half of the baseline by implementing the ambitious scenario.\n\n\nDownload Parameters and REDD Abacus Data:\n\n\nOnce scenarios are defined, users can download the selected parameters and REDD+ Abacus data for further analysis or reporting purposes.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Compare and Interpret Results:\nCompare the baseline scenario with the alternative scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy in reducing emissions and managing land use change. The detailed outputs help assess impacts and guide decision-making.\n\n\n\n2.3 Tips\n\nFor large datasets, the analysis may take some time to complete.\nUsers cannot open two modules or more at the same time.",

    "text": "5. Theoretical Background\n\n5.1 Model Description\n[The Scenario Builder operates based on a land use change simulation model, borrowing from previous tools on REDD+ ABACUS. Conceptually, the model works by comparing historical and projected land cover maps, identifying transitions between land use categories, and assessing the resulting impacts on emissions. The underlying approach is a change detection method, where changes between land cover types are monitored between different time periods. The module evaluates the extent of land conversion (e.g., from forest to plantation or settlement) and calculates the corresponding net emissions offset (CO2-eq).\nThe model generates results by integrating the land cover maps with defined planning units and linking the observed land use changes to emissions calculations. By simulating different scenarios (ambitious, moderate, and conservative), the module helps users compare alternative development strategies and their respective impacts on deforestation, forest cover, and agroforestry adoption.]\n\n\n5.2 Key Assumptions\n\nThe land cover maps used in the model accurately depict the current state of land use and are representative of the planning units being analyzed.\nThe model assumes that land use changes occur in a linear fashion over the analysis period, meaning that changes progress consistently without sudden large shifts or reversals.\nEach planning unit is assumed to be homogenous in terms of land cover and land use activities. Transitions within the unit are treated as uniform, without internal variability.\nThe drivers behind land use changes, such as economic conditions or policy interventions, are considered static or predetermined for the duration of the scenario, with no dynamic interaction between the drivers and land use changes.\n\n\n\n5.3 Limitations\n\nThe accuracy of the results is highly dependent on the resolution and quality of the input land cover maps. Low-resolution maps or inaccurate classifications may lead to errors in detecting land use changes and calculating emissions.\nThe model does not account for subtle, gradual changes within a single land use category (e.g., forest degradation that does not lead to immediate conversion). Only clear transitions from one land use category to another are captured.",
