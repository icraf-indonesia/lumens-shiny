# Overview

QuES-H (Quantification of Ecosystem Services) is a hydrological assessment module that analyzes hydrological environmental services. The current version features a soil erosion risk module based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), with plans to expand its capabilities to include additional hydrological analyses in the future.

**About RUSLE**

The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is an empirical model widely used in soil conservation and watershed management. It provides a method for estimating annual soil loss due to water erosion. Key features of RUSLE is predicting long-term average annual soil loss.

RUSLE can support for land use planning and soil conservation strategies in several ways: 1. Quantifying soil erosion risk across landscapes

2\. Identifying areas prone to high erosion rates

3\. Comparing soil loss rates under various land management scenarios

**The RUSLE Equation**

$$
A = R \times K \times LS \times C \times P
$$

RUSLE is a multiplicative model where each factor influences the overall soil loss. Soil loss ($A$) is the average annual soil loss per unit area (tons per hectare per year). All factors except R and K are dimensionless. The model can be applied at field, watershed, or regional scales, depending on data availability.

**Components**

1.  $R$-factor (Rainfall-runoff erosivity)

    Requires long-term rainfall data, preferably 20+ years. Often estimated from annual precipitation, or obtained from pre-calculated maps

2.  $K$-factor (Soil erodibility)

    Based on soil texture, organic matter content, structure, and permeability.

3.  $LS$-factor (Slope length and steepness)

    Derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and flow accumulation data.

4.  $C$-factor (Cover management)

    Incorporates land use and cover data derived from field surveys or through a classification of land cover types using satellite imagery.

5.  $P$-factor (Support practice)

    Accounts for conservation practices like terracing, contouring, and strip cropping.

# Data Preparation

1.  Total Annual Precipitation Map (GeoTIFF format)

    -   Represents the total rainfall for each pixel over a year (mm/year)

2.  Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (GeoTIFF format)

    -   Represents the terrain elevation (meters above sea level)

3.  Soil Properties Maps (GeoTIFF format)

    -   Clay content (%)

    -   Silt content (%)

    -   Sand content (%)

    -   Soil organic content (g/kg)

4.  Land Cover Map (GeoTIFF format)

    -   Categorical raster with each pixel value corresponds to a land cover class

5.  Land Cover Lookup Table (CSV format)

    -   Lookup table containing raster values (ID) with their corresponding land cover class, C-factor value, and P-factor value.

6.  Planning Unit Map (Shapefile format)

    -   A polygon shapefile of administrative or management zones.

***Note***

*While detailed long-term data is preferred when available, this module focuses on methods using publicly available spatial data.*

*The module will use these inputs to calculate the RUSLE factors (R, K, LS, C, P) internally.*

*Users should ensure that all raster inputs are properly aligned (i.e., with identical projection systems, extents, and resolutions) and have consistent no-data values.*

*The lookup table allows flexibility in assigning C and P factors based on local conditions or literature values.*
