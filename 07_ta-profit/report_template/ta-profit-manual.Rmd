# Introduction

This report presents the results of a Profitability Analysis based on land-use change scenarios. The analysis focuses on assessing the net present value (NPV), opportunity costs, and carbon emissions associated with different land-use changes. This method helps evaluate the financial and environmental impacts of shifting land use and identify trade-offs between profitability and sustainability.


# Analysis Results

The analysis workflow involves several key steps:

1. **NPV and Carbon Data Processing**: NPV and carbon data were combined to create a comprehensive lookup table.
2. **Land-Use Change Analysis**: The land-use change maps were processed to assess changes in NPV.
3. **Visualization**: Maps were generated to visually represent the spatial distribution of NPV changes. 

## NPV for `r params$year1` {.tabset}
The curve visualizes the relationship between potential financial profits and the associated carbon emissions, allowing stakeholders to better understand the trade-offs involved in different land-use strategies.

### Plot
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
params$npv1_chart
```

### Table
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
params$npv1_table %>%
  dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(where(is.numeric), easy_to_read_numbers)) %>%
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE)
```

## NPV for `r params$year2` {.tabset}
The curve visualizes the relationship between potential financial profits and the associated carbon emissions, allowing stakeholders to better understand the trade-offs involved in different land-use strategies.

### Plot
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
params$npv2_chart
```

### Table
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
params$npv2_table %>%
  dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(where(is.numeric), easy_to_read_numbers)) %>%
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE)
```


## Delta NPV for `r params$year1` to `r params$year2` {.tabset}
The curve visualizes the relationship between potential financial profits and the associated carbon emissions, allowing stakeholders to better understand the trade-offs involved in different land-use strategies.

### Plot
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
params$deltaNPV_chart
```

### Table
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
params$deltaNPV_table %>%
  dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(where(is.numeric), easy_to_read_numbers)) %>%
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE)
```

## Net Present Value Maps
The NPV Maps are critical visual outputs that illustrate the financial performance of different land-use categories at two distinct points in time. These maps help in understanding how land-use changes over time impact profitability, providing valuable insights for decision-makers seeking to balance economic and environmental factors.

### NPV Map for Year `r params$year1`
This map serves as a baseline for understanding the initial profitability of different land uses before any land-use changes occur. The map visually displays areas with varying degrees of profitability, using color gradients to indicate the range of NPV values.
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(params$npv1_map)
```

### NPV Map for Year `r params$year2`
This map captures how the financial value of different land uses has evolved over the analysis period due to land-use changes, policy interventions, or natural factors. Like NPV Map for Year `r params$year1`, it uses color gradients to indicate the profitability of various land areas.
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(params$npv2_map)
```

### Delta NPV Map
This map highlights the regions where significant changes in NPV occurred due to land-use changes. Areas with high profitability shifts are marked in green, while those with reduced profitability are marked in red.
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(params$deltaNPV_map)
```

```{r child_documen_traj_fao, echo=FALSE, fig.keep='all', results='asis'}

      paste0("#### Top 10 NPV1 by LC1 in ", pu_name),
      "```{r}",
      "#| echo: false",
      "results_list[[pu_name]][['lc1_bar']]",
      "```",
      "",
      paste0("#### Top 10 NPV2 by LC2 in ", pu_name),
      "```{r}",
      "#| echo: false",
      "results_list[[pu_name]][['lc2_bar']]",
      "```",
      "",
      paste0("#### Top 10 Î”NPV in ", pu_name),
      "```{r}",
      "#| echo: false",
      "results_list[[pu_name]][['lulcc_bar']]",
      "```"
    ),
    envir = rlang::env(results_list = results_list, pu_name = pu_name),
    quiet = TRUE
  )
  cat(res, sep = "\n")
  cat("\n")
}

for (pu_name in names(pu_outputs)) {
  render_child_pu(pu_outputs, pu_name)
}
```

# Conclusion
The report highlights the key trade-offs between financial returns and environmental sustainability. It provides insights for decision-makers to balance profitability with environmental responsibility in land-use planning. The generated maps and opportunity cost curves serve as tools for evaluating these trade-offs across various scenarios.
